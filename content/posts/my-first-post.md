## Timing by Manufacturer

| Manufacturer      | Timing System                                                                                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Abbott            | Ventricular based =>VDD & DDI,when PV>MTR in DDD. Atrial based => DOO, DDD or when PV<MTR.                              |
| Biotronik         | Atrial based timing for DDD; DDI and VDI are ventricular based timing, however there are exceptions: i.e PAC, PVC, VSP. |
| Boston Scientific |                                                                                                                         |
| Medtronic         | Atrial based timing for all devices that have atrial pacing: DDD, DDI, DVI.                                             |
| MicroPort         |                                                                                                                         |

PV, P synchronous V pacing; MTR, Max Tracking Rate; VSP, V safety pacing
